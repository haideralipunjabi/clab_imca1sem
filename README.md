Code from various exercises I performed during my C Programming Lab, 1st Semester of Integrated Masters in Computer Applications at [Cluster University Srinagar](http://www.cusrinagar.edu.in/)

***Note:*** *The implementation of code changes with time, to keep in sync with the syllabus progression in the Theory Class, i.e, earlier exercises use `goto` instead of `loops` and stuff like functions,arrays are also not used during earlier exercises*
